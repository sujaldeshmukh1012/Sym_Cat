PROMPT = """# GUIDED INSPECTION INSTRUCTIONS - CAB AND GLASS
## Heavy Equipment Daily Visual Analysis

### OVERVIEW
This inspection module covers the operator cab, all glass surfaces, seals, mirrors, and protective structures (ROPS/FOPS). The cab is the operator's primary safety enclosure — defects here directly impact visibility, environmental protection, and structural safety in rollover or falling-object events.

## INSPECTION CATEGORIES AND DETECTION POINTS

### 🔴 CRITICAL SAFETY ISSUES (RED INDICATORS)
**Immediate Action Required - Equipment Should Not Operate**

#### **GLASS AND WINDSHIELD FAILURES**
- **Cracked or Shattered Windshield**
  - Look for: Cracks spanning >15cm, spider-web fractures, missing glass sections
  - Detection Points: Diagonal or branching cracks, shattered laminate layers, holes
  - Risk Level: Critical - Operator visibility hazard, no protection from debris

- **Severely Damaged Side or Rear Glass**
  - Look for: Broken panels, large missing sections, glass held in place by film only
  - Detection Points: Shattered tempered glass (pebble pattern), displaced panes
  - Risk Level: Critical - Cab ingress of debris, weather, dust

#### **STRUCTURAL CAB DAMAGE**
- **ROPS/FOPS Compromise**
  - Look for: Bent, cracked, or separated ROPS/FOPS members
  - Detection Points: Visible deformation of rollover or falling-object protection frame
  - Risk Level: Critical - Operator life safety compromised

- **Cab Door Won't Latch or Close**
  - Look for: Door swinging open, broken latch mechanism, bent hinges
  - Detection Points: Gap between door and frame when closed, missing latch hardware
  - Risk Level: Critical - Operator ejection risk, cab environment failure

### 🟡 MODERATE ISSUES (YELLOW INDICATORS)
**Schedule Maintenance**

#### **SEAL AND WEATHERPROOFING**
- **Deteriorated Door Seals**
  - Look for: Cracked, torn, or compressed rubber seals around doors and windows
  - Detection Points: Visible gaps between seal and frame, hardened rubber, daylight through seals
  - Risk Level: Moderate - Dust, moisture, noise ingress degrading operator environment

- **Window Seal Failure**
  - Look for: Loose window panes, water staining inside cab, seal separation
  - Detection Points: Condensation between panes, water marks below windows

#### **MIRROR AND VISIBILITY**
- **Damaged or Missing Mirrors**
  - Look for: Cracked mirror glass, missing mirror assemblies, loose mirror mounts
  - Detection Points: Broken mirror housing, missing bolts, spider cracks in glass
  - Risk Level: Moderate - Blind spots creating collision and personnel hazard

- **Minor Glass Chips**
  - Look for: Small chips (<5cm) not in operator's direct sight line
  - Detection Points: Bull's-eye or star chips that haven't spread
  - Risk Level: Moderate - May propagate; schedule replacement

#### **WIPER SYSTEM**
- **Worn or Missing Wiper Blades**
  - Look for: Streaking, torn rubber, missing blade sections, bent arms
  - Detection Points: Gaps in rubber, exposed metal frame scraping glass

### ✅ NORMAL (GREEN)
**Acceptable Operating Condition**

- All glass surfaces intact with no cracks, chips, or delamination
- Door seals pliable and seated fully in channels
- Doors open, close, and latch correctly without excess play
- Mirrors intact, properly adjusted, with clear reflective surfaces
- Wiper blades make full contact and clear glass without streaking
- ROPS/FOPS structure straight, undamaged, hardware tight
- Cab interior dry with no evidence of water or dust ingress
