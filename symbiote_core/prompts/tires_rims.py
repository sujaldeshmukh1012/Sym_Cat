## Heavy Equipment Daily Video Analysis

### OVERVIEW
This guided inspection module provides comprehensive video analysis instructions for tire and rim inspection on wheeled heavy equipment. **Note: Most equipment in this dataset are tracked vehicles where tire and rim inspection is N/A.** For wheeled equipment, this system identifies critical safety issues, moderate maintenance needs, and normal operational conditions related specifically to tires and rims.

- **Minor Tire Damage**
  - Look for: Small cuts, minor punctures (sealed), surface cracking
  - Detection Points: Shallow cuts not reaching cords, sealed repairs, weather checking
  - Risk Level: Moderate - Monitor for progression

#### **RIM CONDITION ISSUES**
- **Minor Rim Damage**
  - Look for: Small dents, surface scratches, minor corrosion
  - Detection Points: Cosmetic damage not affecting structure, surface rust
  - Risk Level: Moderate - Monitor for progression

- **Valve Stem Issues**
  - Look for: Cracked valve stems, damaged valve caps, slow leaks
  - Detection Points: Rubber deterioration, missing caps, hissing sounds
  - Risk Level: Moderate - Can lead to pressure loss

#### **UNDERCARRIAGE COMPONENT WEAR**
- **Pin and Bushing Wear**
  - Look for: Seized pins, worn bushings, restricted movement
  - Detection Points: Difficulty in articulation, visible wear, metal-to-metal contact
  - Risk Level: Moderate - Progressive wear requiring monitoring
  - Common Issues Found: "Few minor seized pins"

- **Ice Lug Damage** (For Winter Equipment)
  - Look for: Broken or missing traction aids on tires
  - Detection Points: Incomplete or damaged traction elements
  - Risk Level: Moderate - Affects traction in icy conditions
  - Common Issues Found: "Multiple broken ice lugs"

---

### ✅ NORMAL CONDITIONS (GREEN INDICATORS)
**Acceptable Operating Condition**

#### **PROPER TIRE CONDITION**
- **Adequate Tread Depth**
  - Look for: Even tread wear, sufficient depth for application
  - Detection Points: Tread wear indicators not visible, consistent pattern

- **Proper Tire Pressure**
  - Look for: Correct tire shape, appropriate ground contact patch
  - Detection Points: Normal tire profile, even ground contact

- **Clean Tire Surface**
  - Look for: No debris embedded, clear tread patterns
  - Detection Points: Visible tread design, no foreign objects

#### **PROPER RIM CONDITION**
- **Structural Integrity**
  - Look for: No visible damage, proper shape, secure mounting
  - Detection Points: Round profile, intact structure, tight hardware

- **Clean Rim Surface**
  - Look for: No excessive corrosion, clean mounting surfaces
  - Detection Points: Clear of debris, proper finish

## VIDEO ANALYSIS PROTOCOL

### **SYSTEMATIC INSPECTION SEQUENCE**

1. **Pre-Inspection Setup**
   - Ensure adequate lighting for clear visibility of tire and rim areas
   - Position camera for comprehensive view of all wheels
   - Start with wide-angle view, then focus on individual wheels

2. **Tire Condition Assessment**
   - Examine each tire systematically (front left, front right, rear left, rear right)
   - Check tread depth and wear patterns
   - Look for punctures, cuts, or embedded objects
   - Assess sidewall condition for bulges or cracks

3. **Rim and Wheel Hardware Inspection**
   - Examine rim structure for cracks or damage
   - Check all visible lug nuts and wheel hardware
   - Look for signs of corrosion or damage
   - Verify wheel alignment and proper mounting

4. **Undercarriage Component Check** (When Applicable)
   - Inspect pins and bushings for wear
   - Check for proper lubrication
   - Assess ice lugs or traction aids if equipped

5. **Pressure and Performance Indicators**
   - Observe tire shape for proper inflation
   - Check ground contact patterns
   - Note any unusual wear or deformation

### **DETECTION CONFIDENCE LEVELS**

- **High Confidence (90-100%)**: Clear visual evidence of tire/rim damage or wear
- **Medium Confidence (70-89%)**: Probable tire/rim issues requiring verification
- **Low Confidence (50-69%)**: Suspicious conditions needing closer inspection

### **DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**

For each detected anomaly, document:
- **Wheel Position**: Specific location (front left, front right, rear left, rear right)
- **Component Type**: Tire, rim, wheel hardware, or related component
- **Condition Description**: Detailed description of observed condition
- **Severity Assessment**: Critical/Moderate/Minor classification
- **Operational Impact**: Effect on equipment safety and mobility
- **Recommended Action**: Immediate replacement, scheduled maintenance, or monitoring

## COMMON FALSE POSITIVES TO AVOID

### **Environmental Factors**
- Mud or debris that obscures actual tire condition
- Lighting conditions that create shadows resembling damage
- Camera angle distortions that exaggerate normal wear
- Wet conditions that may hide or emphasize surface features

### **Normal Wear Patterns**
- Expected tread wear within operational limits
- Minor surface cracking due to weather exposure
- Normal rim oxidation that doesn't affect structural integrity
- Standard deflection under load

---

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### **Equipment Type Variations**
- **Note**: Most equipment in this dataset are tracked vehicles where tire inspection is N/A
- For wheeled equipment: Focus on load-bearing capacity and work environment demands
- Consider operating environment (construction, mining, agricultural applications)
- Account for seasonal conditions (ice lugs, winter tires, etc.)

### **Integration with Maintenance Systems**

#### **Priority Classifications**
- **RED Issues**: Stop operation immediately, replace tire/rim before use
- **YELLOW Issues**: Complete current operation, schedule maintenance within 24-48 hours
- **GREEN Conditions**: Continue normal operations, routine maintenance schedule

#### **Trending Analysis**
- Track tire wear progression over time
- Monitor effectiveness of tire pressure maintenance
- Establish baseline conditions for new tires
- Identify patterns in tire failure modes

This guided inspection system ensures comprehensive coverage of tire and rim safety and operational aspects specifically relevant to wheeled heavy equipment through systematic video analysis protocols."""
